# "Girl Before a Mirror"
Using Pablo Picasso's piece, "Girl Before a Mirror," I created a virtual environment around the ideas in the painting using A-Frame. 

The walls were remade in Adobe Illustrator to match the painting, but have the quality necessary for the 3D environment. The 
girl standing before the mirror was given legs and a finished hand using Adobe PhotoShop. The mirror and picture frame in the 
environment are .gtlf models that I found on SketchFab.com. 

The idea was to be able to fully immerse yourself in this world by being able to stand in front of the mirror and see the reflected
girl appear by a mouse hover. Her hand in the painting is connected to the original girl's, which is a link I wanted to keep, hence 
the reflected girl's hand appears to be coming out of the mirror in an attempt to reach you. This shows the linkage between 
individuals and their perception of reality.
